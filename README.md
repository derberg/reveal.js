# Overview

This presentation tries to explain what Static Site Generators are, who uses them and how you can start playing with them.

## Conferences

This new approach was presented at the following conferences:
* [LavaCon in Dublin, Ireland in 2017](https://lavacon.org/2017/dublin/)

It was possible thanks to the company I work in that sponsored my travel each time.

# Promoted Technology

* Super cool tool created by [Benjamin Lupton](https://github.com/balupton). It is a static site generator (but not only!) called [DocPad](https://docpad.org/),
* [YaaS](https://yaas.io) as a product documented with static site generators in most innovative way

# Presentation Built With

I used awesome [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/) built by [Hakim El Hattab](https://github.com/hakimel).

If you want to present this topic on some conference or meetup, and you know how to do it, then I have nothing against it.
I just hope that this new approach will influence many people and change their approach to documentation creation process.
